                THIRD PARTY
            </h2>
            <p>
                We may also share website usage information about visitors to our website with third
                parties, such as advertisers on our website, for the purpose of managing and targeting
                advertisements and for market research analysis on our website and other sites.
                For these purposes, we and our third-party advertising companies may place pixel
                tags (also called clear gifs) on some of the pages you visit on our website. We
                will then use the non-personally identifiable information that is collected using
                these pixel tags to serve you relevant advertisements when you are visiting other
                sites on the internet. These advertisements may be targeted to specific searches
                you conducted on our website during earlier browsing sessions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Third party Internet sites available through advertising and other links on our
                site have separate privacy and data collection practices. If you click on a link
                found on our website or any other website, you should always look at the location
                bar within your browser to determine whether you have been linked to a different
                website.
            </p>
            <p>
                This Policy, and our responsibility, is limited to our own information collection
                practices. We are not responsible for, and cannot always ensure, the information
                collection practices or privacy policies of other websites maintained by third parties
                or our service providers where you submit your personal information directly to
                such websites. Please read the privacy and security policies of any external sites
                before providing any personal information while accessing those sites.

            <h2>
                SECURITY:
            </h2>
            <p>
                We have implemented a security program to keep information that is stored in our
                systems protected from unauthorized access. The website servers and systems are
                configured with data encryption or scrambling technologies and industry standard
                firewalls. When you enter personal information during the reservation process, your
                data is protected by Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to help ensure safe transmission.
                Although we take reasonable steps to safeguard and prevent unauthorized access to
                your personally identifiable information, we won’t be responsible for the acts of
                those who gain unauthorized access, and we make no warranty, express, implied or
                otherwise, that we will prevent such access.
